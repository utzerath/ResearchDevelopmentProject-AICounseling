Started Project

IDE used- VS Code

I am going to be using a virtual environment to manage the project before deployment
(Django comes with a integrated server to test)

Steps to start development today:
-Create a project directory
-Create a virtual environment
-Create Django Project
-Run the development server
-Configured connection to mongodb using pymongo

Opened New Terminal
mkdir buildDjango //Makes directory
cd buildDjango // Go into directory
python3 -m venv rdp-env //Sets up virtual environment
rdp-env\Scripts\activate //activating virtual environment
pip3 install django //installing django
python3 -m django version //check to see if django is installed
django-admin --version //check to see if django is installed
django-admin startproject aICounseling //start django project
python3 manage.py runserver //runs the server

Installed MySQL
https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

version- 
mysql installer web community 8.0.34.msi

mySql root password- S?uy733pC7oT

*in mySql command line client*
mysql -u root -p // command to start command line client

Create database aICounseling; //created database
show databases; //shows databases

*back in vsCode terminal* 
pip3 install mysqlclient //python driver for mySQL

added database to setting.py in project 


Make sure pymongo is installed
python3 -m pip install pymongo
//pymongo will be the library to connect to mongoDB

created new .py file called db_connection
Code in here:
import pymongo
url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'
client = pymongo.MongoClient(url)
db = client['aICounseling']
