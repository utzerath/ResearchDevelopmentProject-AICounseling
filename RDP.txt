Installed Git on Windows
Download site: https://gitforwindows.org/

Check if download
Git Bash -> 
$ git version 
//Should output this
git version 2.34.1.windows.1

(Already have Python downloaded for Windows)

Started Project

IDE used- VS Code

I am going to be using a virtual environment to manage the project before deployment
(Django comes with a integrated server to test)

Steps to start development today:
-Create a project directory
-Create a virtual environment
-Create Django Project
-Run the development server
-Configured connection to mongodb using pymongo

Opened New Terminal
mkdir buildDjango //Makes directory
cd buildDjango // Go into directory
python3 -m venv rdp-env //Sets up virtual environment
rdp-env\Scripts\activate //activating virtual environment
pip3 install django //installing django
python3 -m django version //check to see if django is installed
django-admin --version //check to see if django is installed
django-admin startproject aICounseling //start django project
python3 manage.py runserver //runs the server

Installed MySQL
https://www.mysql.com/downloads/

version- 
mysql installer web community 8.0.34.msi

mySql root password- S?uy733pC7oT

*in mySql command line client*
mysql -u root -p // command to start command line client

Create database aICounseling; //created database
show databases; //shows databases

*back in vsCode terminal* 
pip3 install mysqlclient //python driver for mySQL

added database to setting.py in project 

DATABASES = {   
    'default': {   
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',   
        'NAME': 'aICounseling',   
        'USER': 'root',   
        'PASSWORD': 'S?uy733pC7oT',   
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',   
        'PORT': '3306',   
        'OPTIONS': {   
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"   
        }   
    }   
} 

sql_mode: The session SQL mode will be set to the given string. It defaults to 'STATIC_TRANS_TABLES' to prevent invalid or missing values from being stored in the database.

Run the migrate command to use the models in these apps and build their respective table structure in the current mysql database.

python manage.py migrate

Inside the MySQL terminal, run the following commands to show tables:
use aICounseling; 
Show tables;
CREATE USER 'admindjango'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY_'S?uy733pC7oT'; //created a user for django



Installed MySql in vsCode so I can quickly check tables in vsCode


Note for later: Maybe update user and password in setting.py file as the command above.

Tomorrow need to check mySQL connection and make sure its right then set up APIs-> setting up tools and environment then Install and set up DRF 

Setting up an app
python3 manage.py startapp journal // Started app journal
Remember to add app to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py in project

Make sure pymongo is installed
python3 -m pip install pymongo
//pymongo will be the library to connect to mongoDB

created new .py file called db_connection
Code in here:
import pymongo
url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017'
client = pymongo.MongoClient(url)
db = client['aICounseling']
