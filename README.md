This is a django project than I made from scratch. This website is dynamic with serval of pages. I made a user log in page, a sign up page, a page where the user can upload journals, a page where they can see their previous journal entries and download them, an admin dashboard page, and an authorizion method. 

I connected this project to MongoDb using PyMogno.
 The user can upload text entries, video files, audio files, and more to this Database.
 I handle uploading and downloading file uploads using GridFS.
 The user can see their own entries as I query for there username.
 Users can download their own journal entries.
 Users can not see others entries because of the authorizaiton method I impleneted.
 Admin can see all users journals entries. 
 Admin can download users journal entries.
 Provided html and css code: html5.up. 


 This is the website side of the project I, Jack Utzerath, was in charge of.
