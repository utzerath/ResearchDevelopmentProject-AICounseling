# ResearchDevelopmentProject-AICounseling
#This is a django project than I made from scratch
#I created a website that has working html and css code. This website is dynamic with serval of pages. I made a user log in page, a sign up pages, a page where the user can upload journal...
#..., a page where they can see their previous journal entries and download them, an admin dashboard page, and an authorizion method. 

#I connected this project to MongoDb using PyMogno
#The user can upload text entries, video files, audio files, and more to this Database
#I handle uploading and downloading file uploads using GridFS 
#The user can see their own entries as I query for there username.
#Users can download their own journal entries
#Users can not see others entries because of the authorizaiton method I impleneted (Very Basic)
#Admin can see all users journals entries. 
#Admin can download users journal entries


#This is the website side of the project I, Jack Utzerath, was in charge of.
